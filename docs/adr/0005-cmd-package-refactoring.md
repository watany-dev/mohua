# 5. CMD Package Refactoring

Date: 2025-01-30

## Status

Processing

## Context

The cmd/root.go file contained multiple responsibilities with insufficient test coverage. Specifically:

- Command-line argument processing
- SageMaker client initialization and configuration validation
- Concurrent retrieval of resources (Endpoints, Notebooks, Studio apps)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Result display processing

We needed to appropriately separate these responsibilities and improve testability.

## Decision

We adopted a phased refactoring approach, adding tests at each step.

Phase 1: Improving Test Coverage [x]
- Create cmd/root_test.go
- Test basic execution
- Test flag processing
- Test error cases

This establishes a foundation for refactoring without breaking existing functionality.

Phase 2: Implementing Comprehensive Test Coverage
Adopt the following approach for each step:
1. Create mocks/stubs
2. Implement test cases
3. Execute and verify tests
4. Confirm coverage
5. Refactor as needed

Step 1: SageMaker Client Related Tests [x]
- Test client initialization (normal/abnormal cases)
- Test ValidateConfiguration function (with/without resources)

Step 2: Display Processing Tests
- Verify PrintHeader/PrintFooter call timing
- Verify PrintNoResources call when no resources found
- Test JSON format output

Step 3: Resource Retrieval Tests
- Test concurrent retrieval of each resource type (Endpoints, Notebooks, Studio apps)
- Test cases with empty resource lists
- Test cases with existing resources
- Test cases with retriable errors

Step 4: Error Handling Tests
- Verify first error return when multiple errors occur
- Verify RetryableError processing
- Verify error message formatting

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved test coverage strengthens existing functionality guarantees
- Phased approach minimizes risks
- Clarifying error cases enables more robust implementation

### Negative

- Additional test code maintenance required
- Increased test execution time

### Neutral

- Project size increases with additional test files
