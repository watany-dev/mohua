# ADR-0002: Error Handling and Retry Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Challenges in communicating with AWS APIs:
- Temporary network instability
- Intermittent service failures
- Temporary limitations due to excessive concurrent requests
- Need for reliable resource information retrieval

Existing Problems:
- Simple retries are ineffective
- Fixed interval retries can increase server load
- Need for flexible response to different error types

## Decisions

1. Implementation of Exponential Backoff Strategy
   - Initial interval: 1 second
   - Maximum interval: 30 seconds
   - Multiplier: 2.0
   - Maximum retry attempts: 3

2. Introduction of Jitter
   - Random factor: Â±10%
   - Objectives:
     - Equalizing server load
     - Preventing "Thundering Herd" problem with simultaneous retries

3. Retry Possibility Determination
   - Implementation of `IsRetryable()` interface
   - Flexible response to different error types

4. Context-Based Cancellation
   - Handling context timeouts and interruptions
   - Safe interruption of long-running operations

## Consequences

Benefits:
- Improved resilience to temporary network issues
- Minimized server load
- Flexible and predictable retry behavior
- Enhanced resource retrieval reliability

Drawbacks:
- Slight increase in complexity
- Minimal performance overhead

Anticipated Impacts:
- Improved API call success rate
- Enhanced system stability and reliability
- Improved user experience

## Specific Implementation Details

```go
type Config struct {
    MaxAttempts         int           // Maximum retry attempts
    InitialInterval     time.Duration // Initial backoff interval
    MaxInterval         time.Duration // Maximum backoff interval
    Multiplier          float64       // Backoff multiplier
    RandomizationFactor float64       // Jitter factor
}

var DefaultConfig = Config{
    MaxAttempts:         3,
    InitialInterval:     1 * time.Second,
    MaxInterval:         30 * time.Second,
    Multiplier:          2.0,
    RandomizationFactor: 0.1,
}
```
